# Final_Project
Michael Shoemake, Tanti Ouattara, and Jack Grimm

Here we analyzed the methods for creating and subsequentially made a neural network that could potentially be given a deatiled image of a tumor and determine whether or not it is malignant.

In the following repository you will find visualizations as well as explanations that cohabitate with the final neural network that was created.

The importance of this being implimented in oncology is unpresidented, as quickly being able to determine the cancerousness of a cell can save lives.  Also in this project, you will see how we went about pinpointing attributes other than tumor size as well as their relevance to a tumor being malignant.
